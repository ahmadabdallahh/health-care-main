# 🏥 Medical Appointment System - Development and Bug Squashing Plan

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the plan for identifying, tracking, and resolving bugs within the Medical Appointment System. The goal is to create a stable, bug-free, and fully functional application for users.

## 2. Primary Goal

To systematically eliminate all known bugs from the project, ensuring that all features work as expected and the application runs successfully without errors.

## 3. Bug Tracking

We will use the following table to track all identified bugs. Please add a new row for each bug you find.

| Bug ID  | Description                                           | File(s) Affected | Priority | Status | Notes                                 |
| :------ | :---------------------------------------------------- | :--------------- | :------- | :----- | :------------------------------------ |
| BUG-001 | Example: User cannot log in with correct credentials. | `login.php`      | High     | Open   | Seems to be a session handling issue. |
|         |                                                       |                  |          |        |                                       |

## 4. Action Plan

### Step 1: Bug Identification & Reporting

- **Testing**: Thoroughly test all features of the application, including user registration, login, appointment booking, search, and admin functionalities.
- **Reporting**: When a bug is found, add it to the "Bug Tracking" table above. Provide a clear description, steps to reproduce it, and any error messages.

### Step 2: Prioritization

- Once bugs are reported, we will assign a priority (High, Medium, Low) to each one.
- **High**: Critical bugs that prevent core functionality (e.g., login, booking).
- **Medium**: Bugs that affect non-critical features or have workarounds.
- **Low**: Minor issues, such as UI glitches or typos.

### Step 3: Bug Fixing

- We will tackle bugs based on their priority, starting with the "High" priority ones.
- For each bug, we will:
  1.  Analyze the code in the "File(s) Affected" to find the root cause.
  2.  Implement a fix.
  3.  Update the bug's status to "In Progress" while working on it.

### Step 4: Testing & Verification

- After a bug is fixed, the fix must be tested thoroughly.
- **Unit Testing**: Test the specific function or module that was changed.
- **Integration Testing**: Test how the fix interacts with other parts of the application.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure that the fix has not introduced any new bugs.
- Once the fix is verified, update the bug's status to "Fixed".

### Step 5: Deployment

- Once a set of bugs has been fixed and verified, we will deploy the changes to the live server.

## 5. Getting Started

Let's start by identifying the most critical bugs. Please list any known issues in the table above. If you're not sure where to start, we can begin by testing the user login and registration process, as that is fundamental to the application.

What is the first bug you'd like to tackle?
